    "cafeDescription": "This cafe is truly special! The cityscape view from the window is fantastic. It's especially wonderful to come at sunset and enjoy coffee with the twilight. You must try their signature Moonlight Latte. The soft milk foam blended with a subtle vanilla flavor is delicious. It's a perfect space for quietly reading a book or having a leisurely conversation.",
